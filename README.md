The file "TSWIFT" contains the code for the genetic algorithm used for a single song, specifically "Delicate" while the other one (TSWIFT15) contains the code for the entire thing. 
The code was inspired by other genetic algorithms online. 
The file "Taylor Swift Paradox" is the writeup that was done for the project itself.
